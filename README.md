# hello-vianney-world
Since 2022 this is my **very first experience project** in Github. ðŸ™‚
<br> My name is **VIANNEY**
I'm a **former visual designer** (started in 2021 in Italy).
<br> During my visual communication studies, *I dreamed about having my own blog as "The Verge", "The Rolling Stone", etc*. 
Because I love computer sciences and tech. 
<br>**But I hated Maths! (Now it has changed ðŸ˜…)**. So I decided to study Human sciences and a bit of Litterature. 
Later On (2019), **a passion for digital art and graphic design raised up**.<br/>

Until 2025 I've been working as a Designer. Then I noticed a feeling of limitation in my working Experience. 
>But coding and webdesign was taking day-by-day place in my mind and work experience 
(Webdesign and Coding was easier to understand than graphic design actually).
>
<br>2024 was a *"AnnÃ©e sabatique"*. I used to examine my wishes, my carreer. I was trying to understand: 
>"If I'll get employed by getting skilled as a Developper, without engineering studies?"<br> I'm studying languages and framework to start working as a DEVELOPPER by August 2025. 
>
*Then I noticed I've been always working in **webdesign**. This is just a <mark>succesive millestone.<mark>*

<br> Feel free to come back later to see my contributions. **^_^**
