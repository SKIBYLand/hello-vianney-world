# hello-vianney-world
Since 2022 this is my **very first experience project** in Github. ðŸ™‚
<br> My name is **VIANNEY**

Until 2025 I've been working as a Designer. Then I noticed a feeling of limitation in my working Experience. 
>But coding and webdesign was taking day-by-day place in my mind and work experience 
(Webdesign and Coding was easier to understand than graphic design actually).
>
<br>2024 was a *"AnnÃ©e sabatique"*. I used to examine my wishes, my carreer. I was trying to understand: 
>"If I'll get employed by getting skilled as a Developper, without engineering studies?"<br> I'm studying languages and framework to start working as a DEVELOPPER by August 2025. 
>
*Then I noticed I've been always working in **webdesign**. This is just a <mark>succesive millestone.<mark>*

*I have the will to build website like "The Verge" and App like "TikTok"*

<br>By the way, you can visit [my website](https://kanahvianney.com) to see my previous relevant stuff (there are some UX/UI Design projects.).
<br> Thanks for attention.
<br> Feel free to come back later to see my contributions. **^_^**
